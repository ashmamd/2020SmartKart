## Stated (atomic) Goals

* Brainstorm ideas for the web application
* Come up with the Topic of the project
* Research the Technology needed for the project to work
* Create a UI/UX diagram of Home Page of the web app
* Create a User Story
* Develop code for the Home Page of the web app
* Research on the Database needed 
* Research Security Options for the Account (Login) Page

## Stated (atomic) Goals Accomplishments
* Researched online for the platform we will be using to develop our web app.
* Discussed as a group on several ideas for the project. Then, decided to choose to work on a Smart Shopping Cart idea.
* An IDE to code, a diagram tool for UI/UX designs, Draw.io for Infrastructure diagrams, Trello for tasks, and Slack for communication.
* Used 'Justinmind' program for creating UI/UX Diagrams
* Thought of several ways a user can be frustrated while shopping in a store, and how our product can help them positively. 
* We will be using MySQL.
* We will be using SQRL (Secure Quick Reliable Login) which is used for website login and authentication.  

## Bugs
* As of the current phase of this project, we haven't encountered any bugs.

## Security Assumptions
* We will be using SQRL (Secure Quick Reliable Login) to cryptographically authenticate the identity of individuals across a network. It is used for sign-in systems and it can replace all other systems while offering dramatic improvements in usability and security.

## Sprint 2 Goals
* Create UI/UX Diagrams for each feature.
* UI/UX diagrams of the 'Profile' page should include Unauthenticated users, Authenticated users, and administrative users.
* Create HTML and CSS pages for each feature (View Cart, Navigation, Profile, Price Check, Request Help, Accessibility). 
* Create Database Tables in MySQL, based on the Data Schema.
* Infrastructure drawing of the network and database
* User Story in depth (including more features that a user can use) 
* Implementing Secure Transaction method in our Web App.
* Create a Data Schema

## Individual Accomplishments
* Developer - Ashma Manandhar
  * Coded in HTML and CSS to make a website based on the UI/UX diagrams. 
  * Created an index.html and the main layout pages with the three different languages chosen (English, Spanish, French).
  * Showed consistent code commitments on Github.
* UI/UX Developer - Aurangzeb Razzaq
  * Drafted and worked alongside the Jr. Developer in designing the Graphical User Interface
    * Utilized a design program called Justinmind for drafting the design and determining the color scheme and layout
    * Incorporated the three languages our team decided that we will support (English, Spanish, and French) in the splashscreen layout
    * Collaborated with the Jr. Developer on the order and functions of the buttons featured on the main page
    * Sent the UI/UX designs to the Lead Developer for incorporation in the team project
      * included prototype sitemap
* Project Manager - Darsh Patel
  * (add more bullet points or paragraph)
* Jr. Developer - Kajal Patel
  * First, I sat down with an UI/UX Developer to design the user-friendly front end of our Web App. Together, we designed the homepage of our Web App. Taking every detail in encounter such as language preferred by the customer, symbols to navigate to an individual page, a microphone on top right hand side to make the process of checkout faster and convenient. As the UI/UX Developer was designing the page, I was taking notes of each element in detail to pass on the information to the Developer. Using Trello and Slack, I successfully attached the word document of the notes so the Developer can start coding. 

  * Homepage: 
    * A background image of a grocery store
    * “Tap to Start” click symbol in the middle 
    * Choose the language to continue shopping 
      * English
      * French
      * Spanish 
  * Index page:
    * Top right hand side: a microphone symbol to continue shopping by voice recording
    * Total of 6 symbol that leads into their own individual page
      * Shopping card: The items scanned then placed into the shopping cart
      * Navigation: Search for the item to see its location 
      * Account: Log in to your account using username & Password to get discounted prices
      * Price check: Simply scan the barcode of a product to see the price
      * Help: Call a Customer Service Representative for any help
      * Disability/senior: Call a Customer Service Representative for any help  

* IT Operations - Ramzee Christiel
  * (During the initial process, I was able to brainstorm ideas with the team, we choose rolls/duties. We came up with an idea to create a mobile app that would serve as a Grocery's AI. Used as a mobile interface that's designed to cut shopper's shopping time by 50%. As the IT operator, this Spring I was able to choose database software that's conducive to our goals withthe project, map the database, provide comprehensive diagrams associted with the data storage and the IT infrastructure of our first prototype. Also, was able to research the security options provided by our advising proffesor, Jeremy Hajek. I recommended that we implement SQRL. )
