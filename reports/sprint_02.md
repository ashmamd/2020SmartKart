## Developer and Security Assumptions
We will be using SQRL (Secure, Quick, Reliable, Login) for secure website login and authentication. It is an open, free, intellectual property unencumbered, complete and practical system to cryptographically authenticate the identity of individuals across a network. SQRL may be used alongside other traditional website sign-in systems, and it can replace all other systems while offering dramatic improvements in usability and security. 

## Customer Story
A customer is in a rush and wants to buy some snacks at Walmart. As soon as he enters the store, he notices a shopping cart which has a tablet device attached to it. He walks up to the tablet, and sees the following screen:

![Main Page](webApp/main_page.JPG)

The customer would have the option to change the language if he wants to. This customer keeps the default English language and taps 'Touch To Start'. Once he taps the that button, he sees the following screen:

![Customer Main Page](webApp/customer_homepage.JPG)

Then, he clicks on 'Profile'. There is a login page which looks like this:
