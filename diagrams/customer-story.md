He logs in with his Username and Password. As soon as he logs in, another page pops up. He would have a few options on the screen. He could View his Cart, Navigate through the store, view their personal profile, check the price of an item, request help from customer service, request help for Accessibility, or log out of the page. He is walking around and picks up a couple of items and scans it. He wants to make sure if he has the correct items scanned. He clicks on View Cart, and sees the following screen:
